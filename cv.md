## Personal Information


I have graduated from the Faculty of International Relations of the Belarusian State University. I'm careful, responsible, stress-resistant. I have experience in the field of translation from legal English. I am a good team player, doing well with a large amount of information. Also, I have experience in the field of international public law, practice of drafting legal documents, written legal translation from English and vice versa.


Now I have decided to change my area of activity and become front-end developer. I hope that my previously acquired skills will help me in mastering a new profession.
